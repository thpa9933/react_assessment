Hello!

This web app is writtin using React.
To install dependancies run npm install.
To run, use npm start, port 3000.
To test, use npm run test.

Thank you for this opportunity! I enjoyed the challenge.
I appreciate your urge to use modern technologies. I am
less familiar with hooks, so I did not use them. Due to
time I stuck with my roots, however I'd absolutely LOVE
to be on a team that uses the most modern development
practice. I am eager to surround myself with the best
engineers to learn from. I can adapt quickly ;)

Please leave ample feedback as I am trying to get
better every day! All criticism welcome.

I hope to hear back from you all!

Cheers,
Thomas Payne
